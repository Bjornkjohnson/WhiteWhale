* **What?:** 
The White Whale is a website for collectors. Made in Ruby on Rails, the website will be a place for collectors to monitor their collections, share their collections, and meet other collectors.
* **Why?:**
We, the team, felt that there was no real place for collectors to group together. We felt there was a real need for a place where collectors can keep track of manage their collections, especially in an enviornment of other collectors. 
* **Who?:** 
Andrew, Nick, Yarley, Bjorn, and Tony. Five programmers, five designers, five leaders, five creators.
